Brief

Space Invaders

Difficulty level: 2 Space Invaders is a classic arcade game from the 80s. The player aims to shoot an invading alien armada, before it reaches the planet's surface using a mounted gun turret.

The player can only move left or right. The aliens also move from left to right, and also down each time the reach the side of the screen. The aliens also periodically drop bombs towards the player.

Once the player has destroyed a wave of aliens, the game starts again. The aim is to achieve the highest score possible before either being destroyed by the aliens, or allowing them to >reach the planet's surface.

Requirements

Suggested enhancements

Challenges

The main challenge here is the movement of large groups of aliens in formation, and the animation of the bombs and player's shots. There are several approaches here, with collision >detection being the more challenging.
